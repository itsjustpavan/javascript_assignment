1. Write a JS program to create object of person with fields as follows:-
fname - string
lname - string
age - int
skills - array
address - object
	city - string
	pincode - int
dateOfBirth - Date
married - Boolean
profession - string

Create minimum 2 objects and display the object's detail uisng global print method.

1) 

function person(fname, lname, age, skills, dateofbirth,address, married, profession) {
    this.fname = fname;
    this.lname = lname;
    this.age = age;
    this.skills = skills;
    this.dateofbirth = dateofbirth;
    this.address=address;
    this.married = married;
    this.profession = profession;
}

person1 = new person("pavan", "kumar", 22, ["html"], "04/12/1996", { city: "hyderabad", pincode: "500060" }, "false", "analyst");
person2 = new person("nikhil", "goud", 21, ["sql"], "03/11/1996", { city: "warangal", pincode: "500030" }, "false", "analyst")
address = new address("hyderabad", 500060);
print = function () {
    console.log(person1);
    console.log(person2);
}();



2. Modify the above program to create 2 objects, amitabh and abhishek, here abhishek has some common properties from amitabh, try to use it such common properties from amitabh instead of creating it in abhishek.

function person(fname, lname, age, skills, dateofbirth, married, profession) {
    this.fname = fname;
    this.lname = lname;
    this.age = age;
    this.skills = skills;
    this.dateofbirth = dateofbirth;
    this.married = married;
    this.profession = profession;
}
amitabh = new person("amitabh", "bacchan", 22, ["html"], "04/12/1996", { city: "hyderabad", pincode: "500060" }, "false", "analyst");
abhishek = new person("amitabh", 22, ["html"], "04/12/1996", { city: "hyderabad", pincode: "500060" }, "false", "analyst");
var abhishek=Object.create(amitabh);
print=function()
{
console.log(amitabh);
console.log(abhishek.lname);
console.log(abhishek.address);
}();

3. Modify the above code to create third object as "Aaradhya", this object shares the common properties from amitabh as well as abhishek accordingly demostrate on your own.


4. Create a JS program to implement below:-

	   BankAccount
		|(accountNumber)
		|(accountHolderName)
		|(accountBalance)
	-------------------------
	|			|
	Savings			Current
	    (isSalary)		     (odLimit)


Now, 
create 1 object of savings with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and isSalary.
create 1 object of currrent with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and odLimit.

use savings account object to call a function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below 0.

use current account object to calla function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below negative of odLimit.

Now, call getCurrentBalance() from both the object, that will return the accountBalance of the object used to call this method.
